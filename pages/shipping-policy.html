                <p><b>Cruising Through the Guidelines:</b><br>

                    At Torque & Texture, we're passionate about turning your automotive dreams into wall-worthy decor. But sometimes, even the smoothest roads have unexpected turns. That's why we've built a hassle-free return policy to ensure your journey with us is a joyride from start to finish. <br><br>
                    
                    <b>Time Trials:</b><br>
                    
                    You have 30 days from the date of delivery to return your print for a full refund or exchange. No need for pit stops, just let us know your intention to return within this timeframe.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Condition Checkup: </b><br>
                    
                    To keep the engine purring, we ask that your returned print be in pristine condition, just like it rolled off the assembly line. <br> <i>This means: </i> <br>
                    
                    Unused and undamaged: No tire marks, coffee stains, or unauthorized paint jobs! <br>
                    Original packaging: Securely pack the print back in its original box and protective materials. <br>
                    
                    Proof of purchase: Show us your receipt or order number so we can verify your pit stop. <br>
                    Taking the Fast Lane: <br>
                    
                    For exchanges, simply let us know the new print you'd like to swap for in your return request. We'll handle the rest like a well-oiled machine. <br><br>
                    
                    <b>Change of Heart:</b><br>
                    
                    While we're confident you'll love your print, things might not always click like perfectly-aligned gears. For change-of-mind returns, kindly note that shipping costs will be deducted from your refund.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Exceptions to the Rule:</b> <br>
                    
                    Just like every car has its blind spots, there are a few exceptions to our return policy: <br>
                    
                    Custom prints: These beauties are one-of-a-kind creations, so returns are not possible unless they arrive damaged.
                    Discounted items: Clearance prints are final sale, but let us know if they arrive in less-than-stellar condition. <br><br>
                    
                    <b>Navigating the Process: </b><br>
                    
                    Ready to return your print? No need to call a tow truck! Just follow these steps: <br>
                    
                    Contact our friendly customer service team through [+94 75 113 4064/torquetexture@gmail.com].
                    Request a Return Authorization Number (RAN). <br>
                    Securely pack your print as described earlier, including the RAN inside the package. <br>
                    Ship the package back to us using a trackable service (your choice).<br>
                    Sit back and relax! We'll process your return within 7 business days of receiving the print.<br><br>
